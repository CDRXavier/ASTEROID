ASTROIDS

The classic 2D space-shooter. Ammo in the bottomless box.

Shoot at dangerous asteroids threatening to knock your ship apart, dodge the rocks, and watch the pebbles explode into your score, all while
floating around. Go to HyperSpace and appear in a new location, but don't use it too much, or it will corrupt your ship or send you inside an asteroid.

And enter your highscore!
